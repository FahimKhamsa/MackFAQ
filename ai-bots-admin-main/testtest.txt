","Hi Ms. Tremblay,

I hope all is well. Thank you for considering Maggie Oakes for your reservation, we would be delighted to welcome you on the mentioned date. I'll have the pleasure of helping you make your reservation. You may contact us for any further inquiries regarding our group reservation policy via info@maggieoakes.com.

We've implemented certain procedures to help us offer groups an experience up to our standards. We understand that some of the information we ask you to provide us can complicate the reservation process on your end, but please know that all our procedures below are meant to enhance your experience without affecting the service offered to our other patrons.

•	Group contract:
We ask that all groups of 11 people or more fill out a contract, which I’ve attached to this e-mail. 
o	Only the credit card authorization form on the first page, contact information and the choice of menu and wine on the second page need to be completed. 
o	The choices and information you share with us prior to your reservation will help us greatly in offering an experience up to our standards. You can also inform us of any dietary restrictions or allergies in the contract as well.
•	Group menus and food:
For the choice of menus, you will find our different group menu options online on our website at: https://maggieoakes.com/en/groups/. Your group will have the possibility to order the entrées and main courses of their choice from the menu chosen with one of our waiters upon their arrival. Vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options are available as well if needed. Please leave a note in the contract specifying the dietary restrictions amongst your group, and the number of guests with restrictions we will be accommodating.
•	Choice of drinks:
Furthermore, we ask that larger groups choose a bottle of red wine and a bottle of white wine in advance. You may choose the wine you prefer from our entire wine list. Having preselected choices of wine allows us to offer a much quicker service, as it will narrow down the choices of wine to one white wine and a red wine. You may also provide us with your budget per person, glass or bottle and I'll inform you of our sommelier's recommendations. Please inform us if you wish to have cocktails or bubbles served during the reservation as well. Our wine list is available online on our website : Vins et bulles | Restaurant Maggie Oakes | Vieux-Montréal.
•	Reservation time:
Lastly, we ask that groups of 10 or more choose to make their reservation at either 6pm or 8:30pm. We want to avoid the arrival of your group during the busier time of the evening. If you choose to reserve at 6pm, you will have the table until 8:30pm. We wish to avoid any large groups arriving during the busiest period of the evening.  
Please send the contract to info@maggieoakes.com once you’ve entered the necessary information. Thank you for taking the time to inform yourself on our group policies.

The north wing served as a warehouse and workshop where goods were auctioned off, and the south wing was Mr. Gray's residence. Of all the buildings that remain from the period before 1800, these two structures are rare, as their appearance has remained virtually unchanged. These two buildings are also living examples of an 18th century property that combined living and working spaces, as was common at the time."\n,"After Mr. Gray's death in 1810, his wife, Margaret Oakes (after whom the restaurant is named) kept the building until her death in 1825. She left the property to her nephew Frederick William Ermatinger, Mr. Gray's successor as sheriff of Montreal. After his death in 1827, the property was sold to Seraphino Giraldi, an innkeeper and merchant."\n,"By 1850, the buildings were used as small shacks. After the construction of the new courthouse on Notre-Dame Street in the early 1850s, they were converted into lawyers' offices. George-Étienne Cartier, one of the most important lawyers, had an office there until his death in 1873."\n,"The buildings were used for different purposes later on, including as a printing house, stores, stable, restaurant, and brewery. After the fire in March 1968, the owner restored the two buildings, staying true to their original appearance. The property became a historic landmark in 1969."\n,\n,\n,\nWhat is your contact information?:,Hotel:\nWhat is the contact information for the hotel reception?:,"the telephone number for the reception is (514)-656-5600, the email adress is info@hotelwilliamgray.com, the phone number for room reservations is +1 (844) 576-5600  "\n,\n,●       reservations : +1 (844) 576-5600  \n,\n,Hotel restaurants:\n,●       Maggie Oakes restaurant\n,○       (514)-656-6000\n,○       Info@maggieoakes.com\n,●       Terrasse William Gray\n,○       info@terrassewilliamgray.com\n,\n,●       Terrasse Perché\n,○       info@perchemtl.com\n,Spa\n,reservations@spawilliamgray.com\n,1 (438) 387 2008 \n,\nresidence information ,\n,"4 PEOPLE | 975 SQ FT + BALCONY 385 SQ FT, with a separate room of 247 SQ FT "\n,\n,\n,"It's like having your own private residence with a view of Old Montreal.
